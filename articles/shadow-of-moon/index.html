<p>In 1988, Philadelphia police officer Thomas &ldquo;Locke&rdquo; Lockhart, hungry to become a detective, begins tracking a serial killer whose crimes defy scientific explanation. When the killer mysteriously resurfaces nine years later, Locke&rsquo;s obsession with finding the truth threatens to destroy his career, his family, and possibly his sanity.</p>

<p>One important aspect of Jim Mickle’s work: The less you know before you view, the better. I said the exact same thing for his incredible crime noir, Cold in July. All I will say is I’m glad Mr. Mickle made another film. His best work is yet to come. Boyd Hollbrook plays a character that is very relentless and I love how Bokeem Woodbine has become one of the best character actors working today. Pay attention when you watch. Look for the clues. I’m surprised the movie is as good as it is, with all the information you have to process. The concept for In the Shadow of the Moon would’ve made for one helluva TV series. There’s a lot left on the table you could’ve dived into, if you had the time, but I do appreciate the effort from all involved. For a Netflix film, it is very watchable.</p>

<p>In the Shadow of the Moon is an ambitious film, to say the least. It presents gruesome crime scenes ala mysterious villain against strange happenings with people dying of bizarre causes, and a killer that cannot die, in a story told across several decades. The films production looks fantastic, and Boyd Holbrook, Bokeem Woodbine, Cleopatra Coleman, and Michael C. Hall are great in their roles. It’s too bad the writing doesn’t match up with everything else, and due to its plot centric nature, the film doesn’t live up to the potential of its concepts.</p>
<p>The premise is solid enough. In the dead of the night three people, on opposite sides of the city, have died of highly unnatural causes. Luckily…</p>

<p>I like Boyd Holbrook. I think he&rsquo;s an actor that has largely gone unnoticed, except when he has roles in bigger studio tent-pole moves such as Logan or The Predator; he also was excellent in the first couple seasons of Narcos. However, this is why I get agitated when his talents are wasted.</p>
<p>In The Shadow Of The Moon has a great title. Don&rsquo;t ask me as to how it relates to the story of this film, because it&rsquo;s so convoluted that it makes it hard to explain. IMDB reads: &ldquo;A Philadelphia police officer struggles with a lifelong obsession to track down a mysterious serial killer whose crimes defy explanation.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my take on a plot rundown: A…</p>
